Hi! **I’m Priscilla and welcome to my blog.** It features my personal experiences and covers travel, personal growth, academia, books, and everything in between. Following a long escapade of adventures, I have decided to study Physics.

I'm an avid traveler, reader, futurist, and purpose-driven storyteller. My ethos is to combine resilience with curiosity and passion, which in my opinion, you can never go wrong with.

I have a wonderful 11-year-old boy and we both love the cosmos, reading, adventures, and the mountains.
